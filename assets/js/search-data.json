Here’s an explainer, using the Cornell method - my favourite way to work through a subject quickly. . Cornell Method notes . Q A . What is DNS and a DNS query? | Domain Name System is used to map human-friendly service names (&#39;hosts&#39;) to the resource&#39;s numerical addresses (IP addresses) A DNS query and how it is resolved is the process of translating the human-friendly computer host names into IP addresses. DNS &#39;resolution&#39; and &#39;translation&#39; are the same thing. | . How does a DNS query get resolved? | When a user enters https://blog.howapped.com, the browser initiates a DNS resolver which sequences the query that ultimately leads to a translation. The recursive resolver function looks in cache 1. If not in cache, it goes to the first of the authoritative nameservers. This is hardcoded in the OS. For example `8.8.8.8` 2. If translation not found, continue querying 3. Resolver -- queries --&gt; internal cache 4. Resolver -- queries --&gt; root nameserver 5. Resolver -- queries --&gt; `.com` nameserver | . What is the root nameserver? | When a client begins to resolve a DNS query, the remote resolution process starts with a request to a root nameserver. It will respond with a referral to further authoritative servers. A root nameserver is a type of authoritative nameserver. Another type of authoritative nameserver is a **TLD nameserver**. For example, the request to translate `www.wikipedia.org` will receive a response containing addresses of `.org` authoritative TLD server servers. Ao | . How can performance be increased? | The are DNS caching servers which store resolved mappings for a specified period. This reduces DNS traffic across the internet. How long cache entries are stored is according to the TTL value for the DNS record in question. | . What are the various DNS records for? | Besives translating names to IP addresses, DNS can instruct mail agents which is the best mail server to deliver email. An MX record provides a mapping between a domain a mail exchanges. | . Question? | Answer | .",

            "content": ". Here’s a roundup of my professional learnings from the year. . The sections for 2022 goals are limited in scope on account of recently giving birth to our second child :) . Professional . Always be Quitting . Thanks to Julio Merino for the phrase and his excellent article. . The phrase describes how we should approach a software project, as participants, owners and stewards. We should be in a permanent state of being able to handover the project. . It does not mean, abdicating responsbility. . It means encouraging transparency by promoting documentation as you develop. So that at any one time, A project and user can be onboarded or the project can be demoed. As well as the software itself, this also includes documenting your long-term plans for the project. . It means, eliminating, what Google refer to as The Bus Factor. The act of sharing knowledge so no one individual is a silo or bottleneck. This is covered extensively in O’Reilly’s excellent book, Software Engineering at Google. . It means, looking to move on from a project as a positive, rather than a negative move. This can mean sharing your knowledge by training others around you and to identify and train your replacement. When the time is right, this leaves you to focus your efforts on kickstarting new projects. . Resources . Julio Merino - Always Be Quitting https://jmmv.dev/2021/04/always-be-quitting.html | . | . Using a design document to explain and persuade. . This year I’ve found using a platform like Confluence to create a design document has helped to explain and persuade an approach or design strategy. . This is especially true when time pressures have meant face-to-face, synchronous communications have been harder to come by. . 2021 has been a very active year in the hiring market. A shift to permanent work-from-home has contributed to The Great Resignation. . On my own team, we saw quite a radical shift in headcount and time for meetings and proposals has often been cut short as resources are stretched. For a more asynchronous working approach, it’s useful to make a write up with the problem statement and the various approaches available. . Let your audience understand the various Bronze, Silver and Gold approaches to solving a problem, with its tradeoffs and costs. Subsequently, a team can make a considered judgement in a way that’s been documented for posterity. Further discussion takes place in the page comments rather than taking place on a call, or buried in a ticket. . Resources . Chapter 10 - Design Docs - Sofware Engineering at Google https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/software-engineering-at/9781492082781/ch10.html#design_docs | . | . Development using Static Code Analysis for quicker feedback loops . In 2021 I dabbled with Rust. It’s my first dive into high-level, compiled languages since my days of C++ and Java at the start of my career. . It’s worth saying, the tooling around Rust development is first-class and it showed how the compiler is able to present the developer with errors at an early stage so that you fail fast. . In a work project, we also used the Typescript template with Create-React-App. . Using both of these opened my eyes to how the compilation step and static code analysis can help the developer find bugs, antipatterns and other issues at the coding stage of the Software Development Lifecycle without running the program. . Subsequently, in my daily Python-land, this led me to use mypy and Python’s ‘opt-in’ typing mechanism more thoroughly. . Resources .

Efficient learning using a variety of senses . As mentioned above, I was curious about Rust. . From my learnings, it appears that Rust is a high level language that repeatedly appears as a winner in the Stack Overflow Developer survey as the most-loved language. I needed to see what the fuss was all about. . I was curious to see how a high-level systems language compares to Python in terms in memory footprint and performance in general. . Instead of just linearly reading the official Rust book and doing exercies, I used the excellent Rustlings repository which has the user authoring actual rust code samples, correcting the logic and syntax to pass a unit test, and then running the the test suite to ensure it passes. . By not only reading, but interactively coding with what I’d learnt from the rust book, I was putting knowledge acquired to the test. By using different learning methods, with different media, this helps the brain with retention. . Resources .

Post-Pandemic remote teamwork: Do not rely on Jira alone for communication . In 2021 I’ve been involved in consulting for a single software team where we’ve delivered on a couple of data-driven software projects. . I consider this team highly productive and efficient in meeting its bi-weekly sprint goals. One of its strengths has been how we communicate. That is, to use Jira for ticketing, as a documentation tool, rather than a communication tool. . It’s quite easy to fall into the trap of making Jira comments, tagging other team members and then relying on this for inter-team communication. . In a remote-first working world, where an asynchronous communication style takes priority, we cannot rely solely that intended recipients will have digested the Jira notifications. Communications should be reinforced with a quick ping on instant message or voice call. . The sheer barrage of notifications (Jira or other platform) will mean your crafted comment or code review note may get buried in the noise. Use a more immediate communication method if applicable. . Tools and Libraries: FastAPI, Pydantic, React Context API, Mongo Aggregation Framework . In Python, 2021 I’ve gotten to grips with FastAPI and Pydantic which has greatly helped with rapid application development. . FastAPI is an async micro web framework that works beautifully with Pydantic and works with the OpenAPI protocol to produce beauiful API documentation out of the box. This is exactly what our team needed in order to move quickly. . 2022 Professional Goals . Write a Rust crate | Run mypy constantly during development to flag typing errors in Python code as they appear, rather than solely as a pre-commit hook | . Personal . Lesser Minds, the importance of engaging with strangers . In 2021 I read a very memorable book, The Power Of Strangers .",

            "title": "Effective Engineering Management",
            "content": "As we know Software Development is not just about technical problem solving, but the human factors involved when delivering a product at scale. . From an essay in Software Engineering at Google, Brian Fitzpatrick discusses engineering management patterns and anti-patterns. At it’s core are the values of Trust, Humility and Respect. . I’ve analysed and summarised below. . Don’t: Hire Pushovers . This means hiring people that are smarter than you and could eventually replace you. . When leading a team or as indivividual contributor, our general strategy should be ‘We may leave at any time, so have the project and processes in a state where they are documented and can be handed over. . At first, the statement above may sound negative. But this approach means you and everyone around you progress on to new projects and opportunities. . Don’t: Ignore Low performers . The team suffers if there is a team member who isn’t doing their best and you don’t address it. . Keeping a low achiever in your team keeps high performers from joining and encourages existing high performers to leave. . Instead, help the strugglers up, or out. . Don’t: Ignore Human Issues . Focusing all your energies on technical problem solving can mean you’ve neglected colleagues’ personal poblems. This sows discontent, leading to a lack of team productivity. . Don’t: Be everyone’s friend . Becoming a manager or team lead of colleagues where previously you were peers may be uncomfortable at first. . Having a weekly team lunch can be an effective way to remain socially connected without making them uncomfortable. . Don’t: Compromise the hiring bar. . This can happen when you need to hire quickly, the legendary Blitzscale! Don’t be tempted. . Don’t sacrifice the hiring standard because, the cost of hiring the appropriate person pales compared to dealing with a bad hire. . In the words of Steve Jobs, A people hire other A people. B people hire C people. . Don’t: Treat your team like children . Trust them to be great, and they will be great. . Give them opportunity to be responsible for their work. . Do: Lose the Ego . This means trusting your team by respecting the abilities and prior accomplishments of team members. . Help to set goals and reach consensus but the details of how to reach them are best decided by the people putting the product together. . This gives the team a better sense of accountability, ownership and responsibility. . This also means accepting criticism openly and avoiding the urge to be territorial. . Do: Be a zen master . Control your emotions and reactions, because a leader is always on stage and your team is always conciously and unconsciously looking to you for cues on how to react. . This can mean keeping your cynicsm to yourself. . Asking questions is a great way to instill humility, respect and trust because it’s helps the other person problem solve on their own by trying to define and explore the problem. . Do: Be a catalyst . Encourage democracy rather than a dictatorship by building consensus. This can either mean guiding the process from start to finish, or just giving it a gentle nudge in the right direction. . Do: Remove roadblocks . Help the team overcome technical or organisational hurdles to get it moving again. Often this means contacting the appropriate team for getting access to particular infrastructure. . Do: Be a mentor/teacher . Whether you like it or not, a team leader will end up guiding a more junior team member through; code, technology or architectural concept or team culture. . For this you need: . Experience with your team’s processes and systems. | The ability to explain things to someone else. | The ability to guage how much help your mentee needs. | The last point is key because you don’t want to be overexplaining since the mentee will just tune you out. . Do: Set clear goals . You need to define a concise team mission statement to ensure your team is aligned about the direction in which it’s heading. . Then … . Step back and give it more autonomy and periodically checking in to make sure everyone is still on the right track. . This drastically improves the efficiency of your team because no energy is wasted where individuals can pull the product in slightly different directions. . Do: Be Honest . There’s the need for supreme honesty when giving direct feedback. Avoid the compliment sandwich since this can deflect attention from the issue that requires change or improvement. . When giving critism, delivery is key to making sure the message is heard. Avoid sugarcoating. . Kindness and empathy is critical. . Do: Track Happiness . To stave off discontent, here are some ideas: . At the end of a weekly one-on-one, ask “What do you need” . | Make sure people get recognition for their work by tracking the mundane tasks and distributing responsibilities evenly. . | To prevent burnout, track hours and exchange them for fun team activities. . | . Conclusion . Ultimately, you need to be an enabler and plan how you are going to help your team members realise their career wishes and desires. This might be with opportunities to improve themselves or be recognised for the work they do. . . Please buy! I thoroughly recommend. . You may buy Software Engineering at Google here. .

            "title": "Book Notes - No Rules Rules",
            "content": "As soon as I saw the title, I knew this is a book I had to read. . NO RULES RULES . NETFLIX and the Culture of Reinvention . REED HASTINGS . ERIN MEYER . There are 10 chapters which cover the creative workplace culture of Netflix - the highly succesful streaming and film production company. . After having worked in various levels of progressive workplace culture at small and large companies, this book really connected the dots for me. . Here are my notes transferred from my Remarkable tablet (which I’ve fallen in love with) . 1. First, build up talent density . Your number one goal as leader is to develop a work environment consisting of stunning colleagues | Stunning colleagues accomplish significant amounts of important work and are exceptionally creative and passionate | Jerks, slackers and sweet people with non stellar performance or pessimists on the team will bring down the performance of everyone | . 2. Say what you really think (with positive intent) . With candour, high performers will become outstanding performers . Frequent candid feedback exponentially magnifies the speed and effectiveness of your work force . | Set the stage for candour by building feedback moments into your regular meetings | Coach your employees to give and receive feedback effectively following the 4A guidelines (live) (Give) ) Aim to Assist (Giving) | Actionable (Giving) | Appreciate (Receiving) | Accept or Discard (Receiving) | . | As a leader solicit feedback regularly and respond with belonging cues when you receive | Get rid of jerks as you instill a culture of candour | . 3a. Remove Vacation Policy . If you aren’t tracking worked in a day, what is the point tracking days per year? | Leaders must model big-vacation taking to set example and precedent to guide employee behaviour | Explain there is no need to ask for prior approval and no one is expected to keep track of days away from the office | Up to employee to take few hours, days, a week, a month off. | Communicate to provide context | . 3b. Remove travel and expense approvals . Remove, and encourage managers to set context about how to spend money up front, and check expenses at the back end. If people overspend, set more context | No expense controls mean finance departments must audit annually | Fire people that abuse the system but speak about the abuse opening so everyone knows repercussions | Costs from overspending aren’t nearly as high as the gains that freedom provides because employees are able to make quick decisions to spend money to help the business. | When you tell people you trust them, they will show you how trustworthy they are | . 4. Pay top of personal market . The methods used by most companies to compensate employees are not ideal for a creative high- talent density workforce | Divide your workforce ‘into creative and operational. and pay creative workers top of market. This might mean hiring one exceptional instead of 10 adequate people | Don’t pay performance-related bonuses and put into salary instead | Teach employees to build their own networks and to invest time getting to know their own - and their teams’ - market value on an on- going bases Adjust salaries accordingly | . 5. Open the books . A culture of transparency: No closed offices or assistants as guards | Open up books to employees and show how to read Pth accounts. Share sensitive financials | Desicions the might affect workforce well-being be opened up early. May cause anxiety but will create trust (which is more valuable) | If the transparency is at loggerheads with an individual’s privacy - of info is from a work circumstance, be candid but if not, say it’s not your place to share | If you’ve shown yourself to be competent, be open about your own mistakes to increase trust, goodwill, innovation | . 6. No decision-making approvals needed . In a fast, innovative company ownership of big - ticket decision should be dispersed across workforce at different levels, not according hierarchical status. | Netflix mantra and the book’s main jacket quote: “Don’t seek to please your boss” | When employees join company, tell them they have a handful of metaphorical chips to make bets with. A workers performance is judged on collective outcome of these bets | To help good bets encourage staff to farm for dissent socialize the idea and test out the big bets. Teach that if a bet fails it should be ‘sunshined’ openly sharing learnings etc | . 7. The keeper Test . Encourage managers to be tough on performance by asking which of my people, if they told me they were leaving for a similar role, would I fight to keep?’ | Avoid stack-ranking as they create internal competition. and discourage collaboration | ‘Family’ metaphor for workforce isn’t as good as ‘Professional Sports Team’ Teach to instill feelings of . commitment, cohesion , camaraderie | When you realize you need to let someone go, a personal improvement plan is humiliating and costly. Instead use money for a generous severance | Employees may have fear that their job is on the line, so employees should ask their manager to ask ‘If I was thinking of leaving, how hard would you work to change my mind’ | When an employee is let go, Speak openly and answer questions candidly. This will diminish their fear of being next and increase trust | . 8. Max up candour: A circle of trust . A thorough live 360/ feedback session every 6- 12 months ensures clear feedback | Performance reviews aren’t the best mechanism as can be one -sided and limited to just one person (employee boys | A 360 written report is good for annual feedback but don’t link to promotions | Use 4A feeback guidelines for live 360 dinners and start, stop, continue method with roughly 25% positive, 75% development with an actionable (no fluff) | . 9. Lead with context, not control . The overall goal should be innovation (not error prevention) and operate in a loosely coupled System | To lead with context, you need a high talent density. After this get in lockstep alignment by providing and debating context to enable sound decision - making | If a poor decision has been made, don’t blame. Ask what context you failed to communicate. | Is everyone highly aligned on vision and objectives ? | A loosely coupled organisation should resemble a tree rather than a pyramid. The boss is at the roots, holding up the trunk of senior managers who support the outer branches where decisions are made. | These policies, Reed argues do not work for Netflix/a creative engineering culture. Vacation Policies | Decision- Making approvals | Expense Policies | Performance Improvement Glans | Approval Processes | Raise Pools | Key Performance Indicators | Management by Objective | Travel Policies | Decision - Making by Committee | Contract Sign offs | ay- Grades | Pay- per performance Bonuses | . | . 10. Going Global . Map out corporate culture and compare to the culture you are expanding into | In less direct countries, implement more formal feedback mechanisms. | Encourage adaptability. Discuss openly what candour means in different parts of world. Work together to adapt | .",

            "content": "I (Jon) have recently finished this book about management and leadership. It does a great job in explaining empathy, archetypes and ‘general craziness of dysfunctional bright people’ with plenty of pertinent and amusing anecodotes. . It’s written for aspiring and current managers and at 3rd edition, Michael writes as though he knows his audience well. He has clearly trodden the boards, delivered software projects, and led teams at Borland and Apple. . My rating: 4/5 . Chapter Notes . CH4 - Rands Test . Where the ‘Joel test’ can be an effective way to get a health check on a software team, the Rands test does the same for general team fitness in the context of management. . A score of 10 or lower - ‘you’ve got serious problems’ . Do you have consistent one-on-ones, about topics other than status? (+1) | Do you have consistent team meetings? (+1) | Are handwritten status reports delivered weekly via email? (-1) | Are you comfortable saying ‘no’ to your boss? (+1) | Can you explain the strategy of your company to a stranger? (+1) | Can you explain current health of the business? (+1) | Is there a regular stand-up by the person in charge? Do you buy it? (+1) | Do you know what you want to do next? (+1) Does your boss? (+1) | Do you have time to be strategic? (+1) | Are you actively killing the grapevine? ie. Do you make a point to kill gossip? (+1) | . CH39 - Incrementalist vs. Realists . Incrementalists and Realists don’t disagree about whether or not we should do something about the problem. We are disagreeing about how much we should do. … There are two distinct personalities when it comes to devising solutions. . Incrementalists are realists and they have a pretty good idea of what is achievable given a problem to solve, a product to ship. … They tend to know all the secrets. . Completionists are dreamers. Their mantra is “If you’re going to spend the time given to solve a problem, solve it in a manner so you aren’t going to be solving it again in 3 months” . Incrementalists need vision and are driven by the goal of progress and constantly moving forward. . Completionists can often see the immediate solution, and the two-year solution and the five-year solution. . CH40 - Organics and Mechanics . The chapter covers how to speak to your manager and to identify if they are one of two personalities and the interpersonal conflict that may arise between the two. Lopp comments that the ensuing ‘organisational warfare’ is a waste of time (and money) as it focuses everyone on the peculiar personality quirks of the other rather than on the business. . Mechanics move forward methodically. They carefully gather information in a structured manner. They quietly observe and are comfortable predictable. They annoy the hell out of the organics . Organics are all over the place. They tend to be loud and can tell a joke. They ask seemingly meaningless questions. . Mechanic: “This guy is walking chaos”Organic: “This guy is totally uptight” . CH52 - Chaotic, Beautiful snowflakes . Engineers have a well-deserved reputation for regularly being off by a factor of three in their work estimates, partly due to the fact that we are really shitty at estimating the no-linear chaotic work that exists in keeping a group of humans pointed in the right direction. . Michael’s parting thought . The hard work of great leadership isn’t just managing the expected tasks that we can predict - it’s the art of successfully traversing the unexpected. .",

What are the constituent parts needed to start working with the AWS SDK with Python and steps needed to write and execute a serverless script with AWS Lambda. How can this script be invoked by an HTTP endpoint? . Solution . The companion repo consists utility code for deploying the lambda with boto3 as well as detail on the AWS API Gateway service that provides an endpoint to invoke the serverless function. . This is the end product; A serverless endpoint. . . The code can be found on Github.. . Once cloned, install dependencies, set your AWS account ID as an environment variable and run it. .

AWS Permissions with IAM . IAM Resources used - policies and roles. . IAM Policies define the effect, actions, resources and optional conditions in a JSON document. . An IAM user is a person or service that interacts with AWS with their own access to the management console. A user can have a policy attached to them. In this case it is more appropriate to grant policy access with an IAM role. When assuming an IAM role (see Trusted Entity), access to a service can be granted to a user without having to give them new keys as the user can use temporary security tokens. . Create an IAM Lambda access policy for IAM using an IAM client that you create. . The access definition is provided in an s3_access_policy_document . JSON dictionary | Action key Statement with all S3 permissions | Cloudwatch to create log groups and streams for monitoring of the lamdba events | . | . After creating a policy, create role and attach it to an execution role by assuming the role. . Verifying the Lambda was created on AWS Console . By way of sanity check, we can verify the Lambda function has been uploaded in the AWS Console. . For the appropriate region, you may see the function, memory, timeout and our chosen permissions. . . ## Testing the endpoint ## Parting Note This brief walkthrough essentially achieves the same solution as the AWS Serverless Application model &#39;Hello World&#39; tutorial. . Alternative Solution . The AWS Serverless Application Model is a framework that allows you to build and deploy serverless applications. . You may declare the lambda functions to be used and additional resources like APIs and database in a YAML template. It uses an implementation of AWS CloudFormation to define these resources provides myriad other benefits. . The AWS Hello World SAM tutorial covers what we outlined manually above and also shows how to run the Lambda and API route locally and remove the CloudFormation stack to clean up. .

            "content": "The Problem . As part of Covid-19 relief, DigitalOcean donated some free credit for me to work on a local food delivery scheme. . I need to get most value for money by making that credit go as far as possible. It would also be nice to minimise power consumption. . The Solution . The server should be powered-down outside of operating hours and turned back on before start of business. This can be done using the cloud provider&#39;s control panel. . To avoid manual work starting the web app, a service is needed to bring the containers back online when the droplet is swtiched on. . Covered in this article is the process for using the DigitalOcean API to create a droplet with the requisite user_data for creating the systemd service to start containers at boot time. . TLDR; Have a look at the companion repo.. It contains an example dockerized web app and the shell scripts for starting containers and creating the service. . Not covered in this article is the process to automate the power down and up to a schedule. This is covered in a subsequent article. . Prerequisites . A Digital Ocean account (free trial available) | Generate an access token for accessing the DigitalOcean API | Add the token to your environment . $ export DIGITAL_OCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN=XXXXXXXX . | jq installed to format JSON responses Download JQ for your OS | . | . Create a DigitalOcean droplet (optional) . If you already have a web server, with an app, move to section, &#39;Create a systemd service.&#39; . If you do not already have a web server, launch a Droplet with requisite SSH access. . cURL to create the droplet . This cURL statement creates an Ubuntu 18.04 server in London. The user_data key in the payload is used for defining various statements to execute once the server is created. In this case we are cloning the repo containing the dockerized app, starting it, and creating the systemd service to restart the app when the server boots up. . $ curl -X POST -H &#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39; -H &#39;Authorization: Bearer &#39;$DIGITAL_OCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN&#39;&#39; -d &#39;{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;scheduled-serverless&quot;,&quot;region&quot;:&quot;lon1&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:&quot;s-2vcpu-4gb&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:&quot;docker-18-04&quot;, &quot;user_data&quot;: &quot;#!/bin/bash apt-get update apt-get upgrade -y git clone https://github.com/jonwhittlestone/scheduled-serverless-startup.git /root/scheduled-serverless-startup sh /root/scheduled-serverless-startup/start-containers.sh sh /root/scheduled-serverless-startup/create-service.sh&quot;}&#39; &quot;https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets&quot; . SSH into your new droplet . You will be emailed your root password. After you SSH in using the provided password, you will be asked to change it. . . Test the web app is running . The app is running with Docker on port 80, so it&#39;s simply a case of: . root@scheduled-serverless:~# curl localhost A Howapped Project. . Test the service is running . Restart your server with . root@scheduled-serverless:~# sudo reboot . And then ssh and repeat the cURL statement to the web service .

Create a systemd service . Ubuntu&#39;s init system is called systemd and various flavours of Linux may have differing init systems. . Scripting the starting of the web app . We need to define what should be automated which is starting the containers. . In this case, I have an example dockerized app defined in the companion repo, so let&#39;s clone that. . If this directory is present (because it has been previously cloned), then just pull the latest changes. . #!/bin/bash if [ -d &quot;/root/scheduled-serverless-startup&quot; ] then git pull origin master else cd /root/scheduled-serverless-startup git clone https://github.com/jonwhittlestone/scheduled-serverless-startup.git /root/scheduled-serverless-startup fi cd /root/scheduled-serverless-startup/app docker-compose up -d . Lastly, we start containers with docker-compose . Using systemctl to enable the service . Using the interface systemctl we can manage the init system. Each service is called a unit file. This means loading a service, enabling at boot and restarting. . On an Ubuntu system, you may inspect the running services: . $ systemctl status | head ● madebyjon State: running Jobs: 0 queued Failed: 0 units Since: Mon 2020-06-08 05:56:42 BST; 1 day 2h ago CGroup: / ├─3770 bpfilter_umh ├─user.slice │ └─user-1000.slice │ ├─user@1000.service . The following shell script creates the unit file, enables it at boot and starts the service. . #!/bin/bash touch /etc/systemd/system/howapped.service cat &gt; /etc/systemd/system/howapped.service&lt;&lt;-EOF [Unit] Description=HowappedProjectStartOnBoot After=network.target [Service] Type=simple User=root WorkingDirectory=/root/scheduled-serverless-startup ExecStart=/bin/sh /root/scheduled-serverless-startup/start-containers.sh Restart=on-abort [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target EOF systemctl daemon-reload systemctl enable howapped.service systemctl restart howapped.service . Enable the systemd service . The below excerpt verifies we have the working directory created. . root@scheduled-serverless:~/scheduled-serverless-startup# ls README.md app create-service.sh Vagrantfile cloud-config.yaml start-containers.sh root@scheduled-serverless:~/scheduled-serverless-startup# pwd /root/scheduled-serverless-startup . And this runs the shell script to create the unit file and enable it. . root@scheduled-serverless:~/scheduled-serverless-startup# sh create-service.sh Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/howapped.service → /etc/systemd/system/howapped.service. . Test it . We will use the CURL statement to find the ID of our droplet, so that we can then use a CURL statement to power down the machine. . $ curl -H &#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39; -H &#39;Authorization: Bearer &#39;$DIGITAL_OCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN&#39;&#39; &quot;https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets?name=scheduled-serverless&quot; | jq &#39;.droplets[] | {id:.id, name:.name, status: .status}&#39; { &quot;id&quot;: 195393249, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;scheduled-serverless&quot;, &quot;status&quot;: &quot;on&quot; } # power it down $ curl -X POST -H &#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39; -H &#39;Authorization: Bearer &#39;$DIGITAL_OCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN&#39;&#39; -d &#39;{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;power_off&quot;}&#39; &quot;https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets/195393249/actions&quot; | jq &#39;.[] | {id:.id, status:.status, type:.type}&#39; . We power it back up: . $ curl -X POST -H &#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39; -H &#39;Authorization: Bearer &#39;$DIGITAL_OCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN&#39;&#39; -d &#39;{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;power_on&quot;}&#39; &quot;https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets/195393249/actions&quot; | jq &#39;.[] | {id:.id, status:.status, type:.type}&#39; { &quot;id&quot;: 953153688, &quot;status&quot;: &quot;in-progress&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;power_on&quot; } .
