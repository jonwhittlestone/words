What are the constituent parts needed to start working with the AWS SDK with Python and steps needed to write and execute a serverless script with AWS Lambda. How can this script be invoked by an HTTP endpoint? . Solution . The companion repo consists utility code for deploying the lambda with boto3 as well as detail on the AWS API Gateway service that provides an endpoint to invoke the serverless function. . This is the end product; A serverless endpoint. . . The code can be found on Github.. . Once cloned, install dependencies, set your AWS account ID as an environment variable and run it. .

AWS Permissions with IAM . IAM Resources used - policies and roles. . IAM Policies define the effect, actions, resources and optional conditions in a JSON document. . An IAM user is a person or service that interacts with AWS with their own access to the management console. A user can have a policy attached to them. In this case it is more appropriate to grant policy access with an IAM role. When assuming an IAM role (see Trusted Entity), access to a service can be granted to a user without having to give them new keys as the user can use temporary security tokens. . Create an IAM Lambda access policy for IAM using an IAM client that you create. . The access definition is provided in an s3_access_policy_document . JSON dictionary | Action key Statement with all S3 permissions | Cloudwatch to create log groups and streams for monitoring of the lamdba events | . | . After creating a policy, create role and attach it to an execution role by assuming the role. . Verifying the Lambda was created on AWS Console . By way of sanity check, we can verify the Lambda function has been uploaded in the AWS Console. . For the appropriate region, you may see the function, memory, timeout and our chosen permissions. . . ## Testing the endpoint ## Parting Note This brief walkthrough essentially achieves the same solution as the AWS Serverless Application model &#39;Hello World&#39; tutorial. . Alternative Solution . The AWS Serverless Application Model is a framework that allows you to build and deploy serverless applications. . You may declare the lambda functions to be used and additional resources like APIs and database in a YAML template. It uses an implementation of AWS CloudFormation to define these resources provides myriad other benefits. . The AWS Hello World SAM tutorial covers what we outlined manually above and also shows how to run the Lambda and API route locally and remove the CloudFormation stack to clean up. . However, when dissecting software to understand a technique, it&#39;s always useful to strip away layers of abstraction. . . Resources used: with thanks &#128154; .

The user_data key in the payload is used for defining various statements to execute once the server is created. In this case we are cloning the repo containing the dockerized app, starting it, and creating the systemd service to restart the app when the server boots up. . $ curl -X POST -H &#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39; -H &#39;Authorization: Bearer &#39;$DIGITAL_OCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN&#39;&#39; -d &#39;{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;scheduled-serverless&quot;,&quot;region&quot;:&quot;lon1&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:&quot;s-2vcpu-4gb&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:&quot;docker-18-04&quot;, &quot;user_data&quot;: &quot;#!/bin/bash apt-get update apt-get upgrade -y git clone https://github.com/jonwhittlestone/scheduled-serverless-startup.git /root/scheduled-serverless-startup sh /root/scheduled-serverless-startup/start-containers.sh sh /root/scheduled-serverless-startup/create-service.sh&quot;}&#39; &quot;https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets&quot; . SSH into your new droplet . You will be emailed your root password. After you SSH in using the provided password, you will be asked to change it. . . Test the web app is running . The app is running with Docker on port 80, so it&#39;s simply a case of: . root@scheduled-serverless:~# curl localhost A Howapped Project. . Test the service is running . Restart your server with . root@scheduled-serverless:~# sudo reboot . And then ssh and repeat the cURL statement to the web service .

Create a systemd service . Ubuntu&#39;s init system is called systemd and various flavours of Linux may have differing init systems. . Scripting the starting of the web app . We need to define what should be automated which is starting the containers. . In this case, I have an example dockerized app defined in the companion repo, so let&#39;s clone that. . If this directory is present (because it has been previously cloned), then just pull the latest changes. . #!/bin/bash if [ -d &quot;/root/scheduled-serverless-startup&quot; ] then git pull origin master else cd /root/scheduled-serverless-startup git clone https://github.com/jonwhittlestone/scheduled-serverless-startup.git /root/scheduled-serverless-startup fi cd /root/scheduled-serverless-startup/app docker-compose up -d . Lastly, we start containers with docker-compose . Using systemctl to enable the service . Using the interface systemctl we can manage the init system. Each service is called a unit file. This means loading a service, enabling at boot and restarting. . On an Ubuntu system, you may inspect the running services: . $ systemctl status | head ● madebyjon State: running Jobs: 0 queued Failed: 0 units Since: Mon 2020-06-08 05:56:42 BST; 1 day 2h ago CGroup: / ├─3770 bpfilter_umh ├─user.slice │ └─user-1000.slice │ ├─user@1000.service . The following shell script creates the unit file, enables it at boot and starts the service. . #!/bin/bash touch /etc/systemd/system/howapped.service cat &gt; /etc/systemd/system/howapped.service&lt;&lt;-EOF [Unit] Description=HowappedProjectStartOnBoot After=network.target [Service] Type=simple User=root WorkingDirectory=/root/scheduled-serverless-startup ExecStart=/bin/sh /root/scheduled-serverless-startup/start-containers.sh Restart=on-abort [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target EOF systemctl daemon-reload systemctl enable howapped.service systemctl restart howapped.service . Enable the systemd service . The below excerpt verifies we have the working directory created. . root@scheduled-serverless:~/scheduled-serverless-startup# ls README.md app create-service.sh Vagrantfile cloud-config.yaml start-containers.sh root@scheduled-serverless:~/scheduled-serverless-startup# pwd /root/scheduled-serverless-startup . And this runs the shell script to create the unit file and enable it. . root@scheduled-serverless:~/scheduled-serverless-startup# sh create-service.sh Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/howapped.service → /etc/systemd/system/howapped.service. . Test it . We will use the CURL statement to find the ID of our droplet, so that we can then use a CURL statement to power down the machine. . $ curl -H &#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39; -H &#39;Authorization: Bearer &#39;$DIGITAL_OCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN&#39;&#39; &quot;https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets?name=scheduled-serverless&quot; | jq &#39;.droplets[] | {id:.id, name:.name, status: .status}&#39; { &quot;id&quot;: 195393249, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;scheduled-serverless&quot;, &quot;status&quot;: &quot;on&quot; } # power it down $ curl -X POST -H &#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39; -H &#39;Authorization: Bearer &#39;$DIGITAL_OCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN&#39;&#39; -d &#39;{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;power_off&quot;}&#39; &quot;https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets/195393249/actions&quot; | jq &#39;.[] | {id:.id, status:.status, type:.type}&#39; .
