I’ve many ideas deeply entrenched in the idea coninuous improvement - I created some software that helps do just that. Throughout reading, this book spoke to me. . It’s densely-packed with concepts and case-studies on effective communication and general work culture that speak to both the C-Suite and individual contributors alike. You may liken it to the way a great film or play is densely packed with themes, plots and dialogue without waste. . Netflix is an organisation that began life as a mail-order DVD company just before the dotcom boom of the late 90s.

It’s the principle of honesty and candour that presents the need for some guidelines on feedback so a productive, harmonious work environment is kept. The 4As of feedback are introudced in the second chapter. The last section of the book on ‘Going Global’ revisits the points, adding an additional point that highlights the need for international sensitivity when communicating. .

            "content": "I (Jon) have recently finished this book about management and leadership. It does a great job in explaining empathy, archetypes and ‘general craziness of dysfunctional bright people’ with plenty of pertinent and amusing anecodotes. . It’s written for aspiring and current managers and at 3rd edition, Michael writes as though he knows his audience well. He has clearly trodden the boards, delivered software projects, and led teams at Borland and Apple. . My rating: 4/5 . Chapter Notes . CH4 - Rands Test . Where the ‘Joel test’ can be an effective way to get a health check on a software team, the Rands test does the same for general team fitness in the context of management. . A score of 10 or lower - ‘you’ve got serious problems’ . Do you have consistent one-on-ones, about topics other than status? (+1) | Do you have consistent team meetings? (+1) | Are handwritten status reports delivered weekly via email? (-1) | Are you comfortable saying ‘no’ to your boss? (+1) | Can you explain the strategy of your company to a stranger?

(+1) | Do you have time to be strategic? (+1) | Are you actively killing the grapevine? ie. Do you make a point to kill gossip? (+1) | . CH39 - Incrementalist vs. Realists . Incrementalists and Realists don’t disagree about whether or not we should do something about the problem. We are disagreeing about how much we should do. … There are two distinct personalities when it comes to devising solutions. . Incrementalists are realists and they have a pretty good idea of what is achievable given a problem to solve, a product to ship. … They tend to know all the secrets. . Completionists are dreamers. Their mantra is “If you’re going to spend the time given to solve a problem, solve it in a manner so you aren’t going to be solving it again in 3 months” . Incrementalists need vision and are driven by the goal of progress and constantly moving forward. . Completionists can often see the immediate solution, and the two-year solution and the five-year solution. . CH40 - Organics and Mechanics . The chapter covers how to speak to your manager and to identify if they are one of two personalities and the interpersonal conflict that may arise between the two. Lopp comments that the ensuing ‘organisational warfare’ is a waste of time (and money) as it focuses everyone on the peculiar personality quirks of the other rather than on the business. . Mechanics move forward methodically. They carefully gather information in a structured manner. They quietly observe and are comfortable predictable. They annoy the hell out of the organics . Organics are all over the place. They tend to be loud and can tell a joke. They ask seemingly meaningless questions. . Mechanic: “This guy is walking chaos”Organic: “This guy is totally uptight” . CH52 - Chaotic, Beautiful snowflakes . Engineers have a well-deserved reputation for regularly being off by a factor of three in their work estimates, partly due to the fact that we are really shitty at estimating the no-linear chaotic work that exists in keeping a group of humans pointed in the right direction. . Michael’s parting thought . The hard work of great leadership isn’t just managing the expected tasks that we can predict - it’s the art of successfully traversing the unexpected. .",

AWS Permissions with IAM . IAM Resources used - policies and roles. . IAM Policies define the effect, actions, resources and optional conditions in a JSON document. . An IAM user is a person or service that interacts with AWS with their own access to the management console. A user can have a policy attached to them. In this case it is more appropriate to grant policy access with an IAM role. When assuming an IAM role (see Trusted Entity), access to a service can be granted to a user without having to give them new keys as the user can use temporary security tokens. . Create an IAM Lambda access policy for IAM using an IAM client that you create. . The access definition is provided in an s3_access_policy_document . JSON dictionary | Action key Statement with all S3 permissions | Cloudwatch to create log groups and streams for monitoring of the lamdba events | . | . After creating a policy, create role and attach it to an execution role by assuming the role. . Verifying the Lambda was created on AWS Console . By way of sanity check, we can verify the Lambda function has been uploaded in the AWS Console. . For the appropriate region, you may see the function, memory, timeout and our chosen permissions. . . ## Testing the endpoint ## Parting Note This brief walkthrough essentially achieves the same solution as the AWS Serverless Application model &#39;Hello World&#39; tutorial. . Alternative Solution . The AWS Serverless Application Model is a framework that allows you to build and deploy serverless applications. . You may declare the lambda functions to be used and additional resources like APIs and database in a YAML template. It uses an implementation of AWS CloudFormation to define these resources provides myriad other benefits. . The AWS Hello World SAM tutorial covers what we outlined manually above and also shows how to run the Lambda and API route locally and remove the CloudFormation stack to clean up. .

Find out the ID of the server: . $ curl -H &#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39; -H &#39;Authorization: Bearer &#39;$DIGITAL_OCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN&#39;&#39; &quot;https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets?name=scheduled-serverless&quot; | jq &#39;.droplets[] | {id:.id, name:.name, status: .status}&#39; . The output gives us the ID . { ... }, { &quot;id&quot;: 195786885, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;scheduled-serverless&quot;, &quot;status&quot;: &quot;active&quot; } . And then power it down: . $ curl -X POST -H &#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39; -H &#39;Authorization: Bearer &#39;$DIGITAL_OCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN&#39;&#39; -d &#39;{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;power_off&quot;}&#39; &quot;https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets/195786885/actions&quot; | jq &#39;.[] | {id:.id, status:.status, type:.type}&#39; . Which tells us it&#39;s in progress . { &quot;id&quot;: 955320153, &quot;status&quot;: &quot;in-progress&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;power_off&quot; } . The equivalent cURL for powering on the server is virtual identical . $ curl -X POST -H &#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39; -H &#39;Authorization: Bearer &#39;$DIGITAL_OCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN&#39;&#39; -d &#39;{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;power_on&quot;}&#39; &quot;https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets/195786885/actions&quot; | jq &#39;.[] | {id:.id, status:.status, type:.type}&#39; . The web app from the example is running on port 80. We know the server&#39;s IP address by referring to the control panel. Let&#39;s confirm that the service is running by verifying the output in a browser. . . Requests scripts in AWS Lambda . The cURL statements in Python . First, get the ID of the droplet. . import os import sys import requests TOKEN = os.getenv(&#39;DIGITAL_OCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN&#39;,&#39;&#39;) DROPLET_NAME = &#39;scheduled-serverless&#39; headers = { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, &#39;Authorization&#39;: f&#39;Bearer {TOKEN}&#39;, } if TOKEN == &#39;&#39;: sys.exit(&#39;Your environment should have the `DIGITAL_OCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN exported.&#39;) def get_droplet(): response = requests.get(&#39;https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets&#39;, headers=headers, params={}) return [d for d in response.json().get(&#39;droplets&#39;,{}) if d.get(&#39;name&#39;,&#39;&#39;) == DROPLET_NAME][0] DROPLET = get_droplet() print(f&#39;Droplet ID: {DROPLET.get(&quot;id&quot;)}&#39;) . Droplet ID: 195786885 . Now we have the ID, let&#39;s define the functions for bringing the servers down and back up. . def power_off() -&gt; dict: data = &#39;{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;power_off&quot;}&#39; url = f&#39;https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets/{DROPLET.get(&quot;id&quot;)}/actions&#39; response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data) return response.json() def power_on() -&gt; dict: data = &#39;{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;power_on&quot;}&#39; url = f&#39;https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets/{DROPLET.get(&quot;id&quot;)}/actions&#39; response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data) return response.json() action_resp = power_off() print(action_resp[&#39;action&#39;][&#39;type&#39;]) print(action_resp[&#39;action&#39;][&#39;status&#39;]) print(&#39;-&#39;) # action_resp = power_on() # print(action_resp[&#39;action&#39;][&#39;type&#39;]) # print(action_resp[&#39;action&#39;][&#39;status&#39;]) . power_off in-progress - . Running the scripts in AWS Lambda . Let&#39;s translate the cURL statements into Python. . Schedule the scripts with Cloudwatch events . Serverless framework . Quality of Life enhancements . When the target service is unavailable, it&#39;s quite unfriendly to show a blank 500 screen. A subsequent post outlines a solution for a forwarding service which can display an Open/Closed for business page to the user, with &#39;Opening times&#39; . As part of what&#39;s become known as &#39;Chatops&#39;, it&#39;s useful to update team members and stakeholders about the status of the server. A future addition will be to use the Microsoft Teams API to notify interested parties. . Resources .

            "content": "The Problem . As part of Covid-19 relief, DigitalOcean donated some free credit for me to work on a local food delivery scheme. . I need to get most value for money by making that credit go as far as possible. It would also be nice to minimise power consumption. . The Solution . The server should be powered-down outside of operating hours and turned back on before start of business. This can be done using the cloud provider&#39;s control panel. . To avoid manual work starting the web app, a service is needed to bring the containers back online when the droplet is swtiched on. . Covered in this article is the process for using the DigitalOcean API to create a droplet with the requisite user_data for creating the systemd service to start containers at boot time. . TLDR; Have a look at the companion repo.. It contains an example dockerized web app and the shell scripts for starting containers and creating the service. . Not covered in this article is the process to automate the power down and up to a schedule. This is covered in a subsequent article. . Prerequisites . A Digital Ocean account (free trial available) | Generate an access token for accessing the DigitalOcean API | Add the token to your environment . $ export DIGITAL_OCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN=XXXXXXXX . | jq installed to format JSON responses Download JQ for your OS | . | . Create a DigitalOcean droplet (optional) . If you already have a web server, with an app, move to section, &#39;Create a systemd service.&#39; . If you do not already have a web server, launch a Droplet with requisite SSH access. . cURL to create the droplet . This cURL statement creates an Ubuntu 18.04 server in London. The user_data key in the payload is used for defining various statements to execute once the server is created. In this case we are cloning the repo containing the dockerized app, starting it, and creating the systemd service to restart the app when the server boots up. . $ curl -X POST -H &#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39; -H &#39;Authorization: Bearer &#39;$DIGITAL_OCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN&#39;&#39; -d &#39;{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;scheduled-serverless&quot;,&quot;region&quot;:&quot;lon1&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:&quot;s-2vcpu-4gb&quot;,&quot;image&quot;:&quot;docker-18-04&quot;, &quot;user_data&quot;: &quot;#!/bin/bash apt-get update apt-get upgrade -y git clone https://github.com/jonwhittlestone/scheduled-serverless-startup.git /root/scheduled-serverless-startup sh /root/scheduled-serverless-startup/start-containers.sh sh /root/scheduled-serverless-startup/create-service.sh&quot;}&#39; &quot;https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets&quot; . SSH into your new droplet . You will be emailed your root password. After you SSH in using the provided password, you will be asked to change it. . . Test the web app is running . The app is running with Docker on port 80, so it&#39;s simply a case of: . root@scheduled-serverless:~# curl localhost A Howapped Project. . Test the service is running . Restart your server with . root@scheduled-serverless:~# sudo reboot . And then ssh and repeat the cURL statement to the web service .

Create a systemd service . Ubuntu&#39;s init system is called systemd and various flavours of Linux may have differing init systems. . Scripting the starting of the web app . We need to define what should be automated which is starting the containers. . In this case, I have an example dockerized app defined in the companion repo, so let&#39;s clone that. . If this directory is present (because it has been previously cloned), then just pull the latest changes. . #!/bin/bash if [ -d &quot;/root/scheduled-serverless-startup&quot; ] then git pull origin master else cd /root/scheduled-serverless-startup git clone https://github.com/jonwhittlestone/scheduled-serverless-startup.git /root/scheduled-serverless-startup fi cd /root/scheduled-serverless-startup/app docker-compose up -d . Lastly, we start containers with docker-compose . Using systemctl to enable the service . Using the interface systemctl we can manage the init system. Each service is called a unit file. This means loading a service, enabling at boot and restarting. . On an Ubuntu system, you may inspect the running services: . $ systemctl status | head ● madebyjon State: running Jobs: 0 queued Failed: 0 units Since: Mon 2020-06-08 05:56:42 BST; 1 day 2h ago CGroup: / ├─3770 bpfilter_umh ├─user.slice │ └─user-1000.slice │ ├─user@1000.service . The following shell script creates the unit file, enables it at boot and starts the service. . #!/bin/bash touch /etc/systemd/system/howapped.service cat &gt; /etc/systemd/system/howapped.service&lt;&lt;-EOF [Unit] Description=HowappedProjectStartOnBoot After=network.target [Service] Type=simple User=root WorkingDirectory=/root/scheduled-serverless-startup ExecStart=/bin/sh /root/scheduled-serverless-startup/start-containers.sh Restart=on-abort [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target EOF systemctl daemon-reload systemctl enable howapped.service systemctl restart howapped.service .

And this runs the shell script to create the unit file and enable it. . root@scheduled-serverless:~/scheduled-serverless-startup# sh create-service.sh Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/howapped.service → /etc/systemd/system/howapped.service. . Test it . We will use the CURL statement to find the ID of our droplet, so that we can then use a CURL statement to power down the machine. . $ curl -H &#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39; -H &#39;Authorization: Bearer &#39;$DIGITAL_OCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN&#39;&#39; &quot;https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets?name=scheduled-serverless&quot; | jq &#39;.droplets[] | {id:.id, name:.name, status: .status}&#39; { &quot;id&quot;: 195393249, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;scheduled-serverless&quot;, &quot;status&quot;: &quot;on&quot; } # power it down $ curl -X POST -H &#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39; -H &#39;Authorization: Bearer &#39;$DIGITAL_OCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN&#39;&#39; -d &#39;{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;power_off&quot;}&#39; &quot;https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets/195393249/actions&quot; | jq &#39;.[] | {id:.id, status:.status, type:.type}&#39; .
