    <p>As soon as I saw the title, I knew this is a book I had to read.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NO RULES RULES</p>

  <p>NETFLIX and the Culture of Reinvention</p>

  <p>REED HASTINGS</p>

  <p>ERIN MEYER</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are 10 chapters which cover the creative workplace culture of Netflix - the highly succesful streaming and film production company.</p>

<p>After having worked in various levels of progressive workplace culture at small and large companies, this book really connected the dots for me.</p>

<p>Here are my notes transferred from my <a href="https://time.com/collection/best-inventions-2020/5911408/remarkable-2/">Remarkable tablet</a> (which I’ve fallen in love with)</p>

<h3 id="1-first-build-up-talent-density">1. First, build up talent density</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Your number one goal as leader is to develop a work environment consisting of stunning colleagues</li>
  <li>Stunning colleagues accomplish significant amounts of important work and are exceptionally creative and passionate</li>
  <li>Jerks, slackers and sweet people with non stellar performance or pessimists on the team will bring down the performance of everyone</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-say-what-you-really-think-with-positive-intent">2. Say what you really think (with positive intent)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>With candour, high performers will become outstanding performers . Frequent candid feedback exponentially magnifies the speed and effectiveness of your work force</p>
  </li>
  <li>Set the stage for candour by building feedback moments into your regular meetings</li>
  <li>Coach your employees to give and receive feedback effectively following the 4A guidelines (live) (Give) )
    <ul>
      <li>Aim to Assist (Giving)</li>
      <li>Actionable (Giving)</li>
      <li>Appreciate (Receiving)</li>
      <li>Accept or Discard (Receiving)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>As a leader solicit feedback regularly and respond with belonging cues when you receive</li>
  <li>Get rid of jerks as you instill a culture of candour</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3a-remove-vacation-policy">3a. Remove Vacation Policy</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If you aren’t tracking worked in a day, what is the point tracking days per year?</li>
  <li>Leaders must model big-vacation taking to set example and precedent to guide employee behaviour</li>
  <li>Explain there is no need to ask for prior approval and no one is expected to keep track of days away from the office</li>
  <li>Up to employee to take few hours, days, a week, a month off.</li>
  <li>Communicate to provide context</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3b-remove-travel-and-expense-approvals">3b. Remove travel and expense approvals</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Remove, and encourage managers to set context about how to spend money up front, and check expenses at the back end. If people overspend, set more context</li>
  <li>No expense controls mean finance departments must audit annually</li>
  <li>Fire people that abuse the system but speak about the abuse opening so everyone knows repercussions</li>
  <li>Costs from overspending aren’t nearly as high as the gains that freedom provides because employees are able to make quick decisions to spend money to help the business.</li>
  <li>When you tell people you trust them, they will show you how trustworthy they are</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-pay-top-of-personal-market">4. Pay top of personal market</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The methods used by most companies to compensate employees are not ideal for a creative high- talent density workforce</li>
  <li>Divide your workforce ‘into creative and operational. and pay creative workers top of market. This might mean hiring one exceptional instead of 10 adequate people</li>
  <li>Don’t pay performance-related bonuses and put into salary instead</li>
  <li>Teach employees to build their own networks and to invest time getting to know their own - and their teams’ - market value on an on- going bases Adjust salaries accordingly</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="5-open-the-books">5. Open the books</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A culture of transparency: No closed offices or assistants as guards</li>
  <li>Open up books to employees and show how to read Pth accounts. Share sensitive financials</li>
  <li>Desicions the might affect workforce well-being be opened up early. May cause anxiety but will create trust (which is more valuable)</li>
  <li>If the transparency is at loggerheads with an individual’s privacy - of info is from a work circumstance, be candid but if not, say it’s not your place to share</li>
  <li>If you’ve shown yourself to be competent, be open about your own mistakes to increase trust, goodwill, innovation</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="6-no-decision-making-approvals-needed">6. No decision-making approvals needed</h3>

<ul>
  <li>In a fast, innovative company ownership of big - ticket decision should be dispersed across workforce at different levels, not according hierarchical status.</li>
  <li>Netflix mantra and the book’s main jacket quote: “Don’t seek to please your boss”</li>
  <li>When employees join company, tell them they have a handful of metaphorical chips to make bets with. A workers performance is judged on collective outcome of these bets</li>
  <li>To help good bets encourage staff to farm for dissent socialize the idea and test out the big bets. Teach that if a bet fails it should be ‘sunshined’ openly sharing learnings etc</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="7-the-keeper-test">7. The keeper Test</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Encourage managers to be tough on performance by asking which of my people, if they told me they were leaving for a similar role, would I fight to keep?’</li>
  <li>Avoid stack-ranking as they create internal competition. and discourage collaboration</li>
  <li>‘Family’ metaphor for workforce isn’t as good as ‘Professional Sports Team’ Teach to instill feelings of . commitment, cohesion , camaraderie</li>
  <li>When you realize you need to let someone go, a personal improvement plan is humiliating and costly. Instead use money for a generous severance</li>
  <li>Employees may have fear that their job is on the line, so employees should ask their manager to ask ‘If I was thinking of leaving, how hard would you work to change my mind’</li>
  <li>When an employee is let go, Speak openly and answer questions candidly. This will diminish their fear of being next and increase trust</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="8-max-up-candour-a-circle-of-trust">8. Max up candour: A circle of trust</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A thorough live 360/ feedback session every 6- 12 months ensures clear feedback</li>
  <li>Performance reviews aren’t the best mechanism as can be one -sided and limited to just one person (employee boys</li>
  <li>A 360 written report is good for annual feedback but don’t link to promotions</li>
  <li>Use 4A feeback guidelines for live 360 dinners and start, stop, continue method with roughly 25% positive, 75% development with an actionable (no fluff)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="9-lead-with-context-not-control">9. Lead with context, not control</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The overall goal should be innovation (not error prevention) and operate in a loosely coupled System</li>
  <li>To lead with context, you need a high talent density. After this get in lockstep alignment by providing and debating context to enable sound decision - making</li>
  <li>If a poor decision has been made, don’t blame. Ask what context you failed to communicate.</li>
  <li>Is everyone highly aligned on vision and objectives ?</li>
  <li>A loosely coupled organisation should resemble a tree rather than a pyramid. The boss is at the roots, holding up the trunk of senior managers who support the outer branches where decisions are made.</li>
  <li>These policies, Reed argues do not work for Netflix/a creative engineering culture.
    <ul>
      <li>Vacation Policies</li>
      <li>Decision- Making approvals</li>
      <li>Expense Policies</li>
      <li>Performance Improvement Glans</li>
      <li>Approval Processes</li>
      <li>Raise Pools</li>
      <li>Key Performance Indicators</li>
      <li>Management by Objective</li>
      <li>Travel Policies</li>
      <li>Decision - Making by Committee</li>
      <li>Contract Sign offs</li>
      <li>ay- Grades</li>
      <li>Pay- per performance Bonuses</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="10-going-global">10. Going Global</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Map out corporate culture and compare to the culture you are expanding into</li>
  <li>In less direct countries, implement more formal feedback mechanisms.</li>
  <li>Encourage adaptability. Discuss openly what candour means in different parts of world. Work together to adapt</li>
</ul>
