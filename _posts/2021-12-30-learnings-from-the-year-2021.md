## Professional

### Always be Quitting

Thanks to Julio Merino for the phrase and his excellent [article](https://jmmv.dev/2021/04/always-be-quitting.html).

The phrase describes how we should approach a software project, as participants, owners and stewards. We should be in a permanent state of being able to handover the project.

It means encouraging transparency by promoting documentation as you develop. So that at any one time, A project and user can be onboarded or the project can be demoed. As well as the software itself, this also includes documenting your long-term plans for the project.

It means, eliminating, what Google refer to as The Bus Factor. The act of sharing knowledge so no one individual is a knowledge silo. This is covered extensively in [O'Reilly's excellent book, Software Engineering at Google](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/software-engineering-at/9781492082781/).

It means, looking to move on from a project as a positive, rather than a negative move. This can mean sharing your knowledge by training others around you and to identify and train your replacement. When the time is right, this leaves you to focus your efforts on kickstarting new projects.

### Using a design document to explain and persuade.

This year I've found that using a platform like Confluence to create a design document has helped to explain and persuade an approach or design strategy.

This is especially true when time pressures have meant face-to-face, synchronous communications have been harder to come by.

2021 has been a very active year in the hiring market. A shift to permanent work-from-home has contributed to [The Great Resignation](https://hbr.org/2021/09/who-is-driving-the-great-resignation).

On my own team, we saw quite a radical shift in personnel and time for meetings and proposals has often been cut short. For a more asynchronous working approach, it's useful to make a write up with the problem statement and the various approaches available.

By letting your audience understand the various Bronze, Silver and Gold approaches to solving a problem, a team can make a considered judgement in a way that's been documented for posterity. Having commenting on confluence allows for further discussion, rather than it taking place on a call, or buried in a ticket.
