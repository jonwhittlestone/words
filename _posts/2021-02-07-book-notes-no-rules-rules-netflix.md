As soon as I heard the title, I knew this is a book I had to read.

> NO RULES RULES
>
> NETFLIX and the Culture of Reinvention
>
> REED HASTINGS
>
> ERIN MEYER

Just the bold title alone conveys frankness, boldness and candour to a potential reader.
My hunch was that the storytelling would likely be engaging from such a creative company.

I've many ideas deeply entrenched in the idea coninuous improvement - I created [some software](https://github.com/jonwhittlestone/kaizen-async) that helps do just that. So this book spoke to me.

My rating: 4/5
