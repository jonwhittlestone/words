As soon as I saw the title, I knew this is a book I had to read.

> NO RULES RULES
>
> NETFLIX and the Culture of Reinvention
>
> REED HASTINGS
>
> ERIN MEYER

Just the bold title alone conveys frankness, boldness and candour to a potential reader.
My hunch was that the storytelling would likely be engaging from such a creative company.

I've many ideas deeply entrenched in the idea coninuous improvement - I created [some software](https://github.com/jonwhittlestone/kaizen-async) that helps do just that. Throughout reading, this book spoke to me. 

It's densely-packed with concepts on effective communication of work culture that speak to both the C-Suite and individual contributors alike. You may liken it to the way a great film or play is densely packed with themes, plots and dialogue without waste.

Netflix is an organisation that began life as a mail-order DVD company just before the dotcom boom of the late 90s. The book shows how the company has steadily transitioned to a global content video on demand streaming platform and production company in 20 years by explaining their attitude to human resources.

The book is written by Reed Hastings - Netflix CEO and Erin Meyer - an academic and [author](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22085568-the-culture-map).
