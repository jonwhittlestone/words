As we know Software Development is not just about technical problem solving but the human factors involved when delivering a product at scale.

Trust, Humility and Respect are the core principles at the core of Brian Fitzpatrick's dos and don'ts. From an essay in Software Engineering at Google.

First up, the anti-patterns, and then the patterns:

__Don't__: Hire Pushovers

This means hiring people that are smarter than you and could eventually replace you.

When leading a team or as indivividual contributor, our general strategy should be 'We may leave at any time, so have the project and processes in a state where they are documented and can be handed over'

At first, the statement above might sound negative. But this approach means you and everyone around you progress on to new projects and opportunities.

__Don't__: Ignore Low performers

If there is a team member who isn't doing their best, if you don't address it, the team will suffer.

It keeps high performers from joining and encourages existing high performers to leave.

Instead, help them __up__, or out.

__Don't__: Ignore Human Issues

Focusing all your energies on technical problem solving can mean you've neglectted colleagues' personal poblems. This sows discontent leading to a lack of productivity

__Don't__: Ignore Human Issues

__Don't__: Be everyone's Friend

Becoming a manager or team lead of colleague's where you previously been peers may be uncomfortable at first.

Having a weekly team lunch can be an effective way to remain socially connected without making them uncomfortable.

__Don't__: Compromise the hiring bar.

This can happen when you need to hire quickly, the legendary Blitzscale! Don't be tempted.

Don't sacrifice hiring standard because the cost of hiring the appropriate person pales compared to dealing with a bad hire.

In the words of Steve Jobs, _A people hire other A people. B people hire C people._

__Don't__: Treat your team like Children

Trust them to be great, and they will be great.

Give them opportunity to be responsible for their work.

__Do__: Lose the Ego

This means trusting your team by respecting the abilities and prior accomplishments of team members.

Help to set goals and reaching consensus but the details in how to reach them are best decided by the people putting the product together.

This provides them with a better sense of accountability, ownership and responsibility.

This also means accepting criticism openly and avoiding the urge to be territorial.

__Do__: Be a zen master

Control your emotions and reactions because a leader is always on stage and your team is always conciously and unconcisly looking to you for cues on how to react.

This can mean keeping your cynicsm to yourself.

Asking questions is a great way to instill humility, respect and trust because it's helping the other person solve the problem on their wn by trying to define and explore the problem.

__Do__: Be a catalyst

Encourage democracy rather than a dictatorship by building consensus. This can either mean guiding the process from start to finish, or just giving it a gently nudge in the right direction.


__Do__: Remove roadblocks

Help the team overcome technical or organisational hurdles to get it moving again. This often means who to contact to get your team access to needed resources.

__Do__: Be a mentor/teacher

Whether you like it or not, a team leader will end up guiding a more junior team member through; code, technology or architectural concepts of the product or team culture.

For this you need:

  1. Experience with your team's processes and systems.
  2. The ability to explain things to someone else.
  3. The ability to guage how much help your mentee needs.

  The last point is key because you don't want to be overexplaining since the mentee will just tune you out.

__Do__: Set clear goals

You need to define a concise teaam mission statement to ensure your team is aligned about the direction in which it's heading.

Then ...

Step back and give it more autonomy and periodically checking in to make sure everyone is still on the right track.

This drastically improves the efficiency of your team because no energy is wasted where individuals can pull the product in slightly different directions.

__Do__: Be Honest

There's the need for supreme honsesty when giving direct feedback. Avoid the compliment sandwich.
