AWS have released an update on their most popular and wide-ranging certification course. 

The software architect exam at associate level SAA-C01 has been retired and SAA-C02 takes its place.

Commenters with experience of the two will maintain that as long as you keep to the fundamentals of the [5 pillars of the well-architected framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/?wa-lens-whitepapers.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortDate&wa-lens-whitepapers.sort-order=desc), the two exams have mostly the same content.

It pays to be aware of the new products AWS offer. We know that being able to leverage natively provided technologies from a cloud provider will often present efficiency gains in the [Software Development Lifecycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle).

In the SAA-C02 exam, the new technologies we should be aware of:
