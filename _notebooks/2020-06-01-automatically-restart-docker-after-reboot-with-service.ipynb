    "As part of Covid-19 relief, DigitalOcean donated some free credit for me to work on a local food delivery scheme.\n",

    "The server should be powered-down outside of operating hours and turned back on before start of business. This can be done using the cloud provider's control panel.\n",

    "To avoid manual work to start the web app, a service is needed to bring the containers back online when the droplet is swtiched on.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**TLDR; Have a look at the [companion repo.](https://github.com/jonwhittlestone/scheduled-serverless-startup). It contains an example dockerized web app and the shell scripts for starting containers and creating the service.**\n",
