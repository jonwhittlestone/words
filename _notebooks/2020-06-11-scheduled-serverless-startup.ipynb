    "# The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the Covid-19 effort, Digital Ocean donated some free credit to us to work on a local food delivery scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make that credit go as far as possible and to minimise power consumption, we'd like to power up and down the servers according to a schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Esimated cost saving...\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how to do that with AWS Lambda, with cloudfront events. We iterate on that to use the Serverless Framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TLDR; Have a look at the [companion repo.](https://github.com/jonwhittlestone/scheduled-serverless-startup). It contains an example dockerized web app and the shell scripts for starting containers and creating the service.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This article covers how to automate with a Digital Ocean droplet so to follow along with the code, you can create one using the example from [a previous article](http://words.howapped.com/systemd/automation/2020/06/01/automatically-restart-docker-after-reboot-with-service.html#cURL-to-create-the-droplet).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will examine the cURL statements, convert those into Python. We can use AWS Lambda to execute the Python in a serverless environment. Then, the AWS lambda functions can be triggered by Cloudwatch events to a schedule so machines can be brought online only during operating hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can notify any interested parties using Microsoft Teams - a topic for a subsequent post.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "You can always check the [companion repo.](https://github.com/jonwhittlestone/scheduled-serverless-startup)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* .. have `jq` installed to format JSON responses\n",
    "    * [Download JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) for your OS\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* .. have a server on which a dockerized web app will start automatically when the server is restarted\n",
    "    * See previous article on how to [create one with DigitalOcean](http://words.howapped.com/systemd/automation/2020/06/01/automatically-restart-docker-after-reboot-with-service.html#cURL-to-create-the-droplet).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* .. have [installed Boto3 with your AWS account credentials](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html#installation) so we can work with the AWS Python SDK.\n"
