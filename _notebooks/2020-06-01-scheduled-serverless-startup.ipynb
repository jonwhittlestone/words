    "# The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the Covid-19 effort, Digital Ocean donated some free credit to us to work on a local food delivery scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make that credit go as far as possible and to minimise power consumption, we'd like to power up and down the servers according to a schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Esimated cost saving...\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how to do that with AWS Lambda, with cloudfront events. We iterate on that to use the Serverless Framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow along, there is a bit of set up involved to launch a Droplet that you can inspect with SSH if you need. \n",
    "\n",
    "You could always just check the [companion repo.](https://github.com/jonwhittlestone/scheduled-serverless-startup)\n",
    "\n",
